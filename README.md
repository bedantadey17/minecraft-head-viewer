# Minecraft Head Stealer
Shows Minecraft heads (with/without overlays) after an username is entered.

Once you enter your Minecraft username or UUID, you have an option to show the image with or without an overlay (aka 2nd layer). You can click `Save Image` and download from the new tab (right click, save image as).
